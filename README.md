# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Created a model using classification algorithm to predict survival or not

# Problem Statement:

### The RMS Titanic was known as the unsinkable ship and was the largest, most luxurious passenger ship of its time. Sadly, the British ocean liner sank on April 15, 1912, killing over 1500 people while just 705 survived.In this article, we will analyze the Titanic data set and make  predictions. One prediction to see which passengers on board the ship would survive and then another prediction to see if we wouldâ€™ve survived.

# About Dataset:
### Get a count of the number of rows and columns in the data set. Note that each row is a passenger onboard the ship and the columns are data points for each passenger.There are 891 rows/passengers and 15 columns/data points in the data set.
